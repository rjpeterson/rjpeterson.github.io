I’ve always been a tinkerer. Even as a kid I would sneak downstairs into my father’s workshop to assemble scraps of wood into makeshift swords to fend off my brothers. As a young adult I grew ever more fascinated with the inner workings of complex machines like bicycles and pianos, and I would spend entire days disassembling something just to put it back together again. That fascination soon grew into a desire to create something new. I dove into topics like metalworking and computer programming, obsessed with the feeling of accomplishment that came when a device or program that I created came to life.

I have always maintained a mentality that it is better to “learn by doing” as opposed to “learn and then do”. Theoretical work or understanding is just that, and can never replace the knowledge gained from real practical failures and successes. Over time I have learned that relentless organization does a great deal to counterbalance the occasional disorder created while “learning by doing”. Prioritizing organization in this way has also allowed me to work effectively both as a part of a team as well as in solo business endeavors.
