As a kid I was always tinkering in my dad's basement workshop. I even had my own miniature workbench where I would carefully craft wooden swords for use in fending off my older brothers. As I got older I nurtured that curiosity into a passion for metal and wood working. The ability to fix or create something useful with my own two hands was like a superpower.
