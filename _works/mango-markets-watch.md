<!-- Utilized the Chrome Extensions API, AlpineJS and Typescript to create a custom browser extension that allows users of the Mango Markets derivatives trading platform to easily monitor borrow, lend and funding rates.  The extension also fetched information about accounts input by the user and allowed the user to set browser and OS alerts when certain market conditions were met. -->
