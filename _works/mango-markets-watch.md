Traders on Mango Markets require frequent updates about the interest rates on the platform in order to ensure their positions are profitable. The pre-existing methods for retrieving this data were cumbersome and click-heavy. To solve this problem I created a browser extension with the goal of collecting all of these interest rates in one place and displaying them in an easy to use way. With feedback from the Mango Markets community, I later added new features such as interest rate alerts, account imports and token selection.
