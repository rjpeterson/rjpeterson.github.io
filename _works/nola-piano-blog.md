Over eight years of tuning and repairing pianos in New Orleans, Louisiana, I incrementally created one of the most detailed free piano repair technical blogs available anywhere online. Piano technicians, owners and enthusiasts regularly message me hoping to discuss their questions or concerns in more detail. Through these correspondences I have made numerous professional and personal connections with people all over the world. Topics I have written about include "What tuning lever should I buy?", various technical and historical book reviews, "Player Piano Rebuilding", and "The Best and Worst Places in the House to Keep Your Piano".
