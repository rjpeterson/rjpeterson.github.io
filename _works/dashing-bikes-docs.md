As the general manager and lead mechanic at Dashing Bicycles, I took it as my personal mission to increase effeciency in all aspects of shop operation. Over several years I developed and standardized everything from repair check-ins to inventory checking. I also documented in detail advanced repair procedures to use in training new mechanics. Additionaly, I wrote several R scripts to automate common tasks related to inventory and stock ordering. I have included below a handful of the documentation that I produced during my time as General Manager.
