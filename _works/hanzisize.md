While studying Mandarin Chinese in Taiwan under the Huayu Enrichment Scholarship, I ran into a lot of challenges. One of which was reading Chinese on my laptop browser. The characters were often so small that it was impossible for me to distinguish similar looking characters. I could zoom the page or increase the text size, but this would cause all the other page elements to get larger as well, which was not what I needed.

So, I created Hanzisize, a browser extension to selectively adjust the size only of Chinese text. Hanzisize relies on ReactJs, Typescript, the Chrome Extensions API and the Jest testing framework.

    <img src="/images/hanzisize-3.png" loading="lazy" alt="Work">
    <img src="/images/hanzisize-4.png" loading="lazy" alt="Work">
  </div>
</div>

After an enthusiastic reception from the Chinese learning community, I decided to extend the funcionality of Hanzisize to support a total of ten non-Latin script languages including Arabic, Hebrew, Thai and Korean.
