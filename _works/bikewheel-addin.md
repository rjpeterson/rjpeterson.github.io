In an effort to better understand programmatic 3D modeling, I created the BikeWheel Python Add-in for Fusion360. This add-in can generate dimensionally accurate 3d models of hubs, spokes, rims or even entire wheels at the click of a button. The add-in comes preloaded with settings to generate many industry standard rims and hubs, as well as the ability for users to input their own parameters for each type of component.

Programmatic modeling is extremely difficult, as it basically required modeling "blind". Challenges facing Add-in developers include selecting proper edges and faces for extrusion without a graphical representation, anticipating the types of inputs users will enter, and ensuring Add-ins run properly on different versions of the software.

BikeWheel is a work in progress.
