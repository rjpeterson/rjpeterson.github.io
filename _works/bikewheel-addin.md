In an effort to better understand programmatic 3D modeling, I created the BikeWheel Python Add-in for Fusion360. This add-in can generate dimensionally accurate 3d models of hubs, spokes, rims or even entire wheels at the click of a button. The add-in comes preloaded with settings to generate many industry standard rims and hubs, as well as the ability for users to input their own parameters for each type of component.

The full code for the add-in can be [seen on Github.](https://github.com/rjpeterson/LearnFusion360API/tree/main/AddIns/BikeWheel)
