For much of my time in New Orleans I built custom lugged bike frames and racks out of my personal workshop. These frames were designed and built completely from scratch using CroMoly and stainless steel tubing. All tube mitering was done by hand and silver/bronze brazing was done first with traditional oxy-acetelyne and later with propane and oxygen supplied by a modified medical oxygen concentrator. Frame styles that I have built include touring, city, and track.
