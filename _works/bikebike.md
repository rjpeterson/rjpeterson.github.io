In 2013 I was a part of the core organizing team for BikeBike, an international conference for community bike projects. Every year, a different North American city steps up to host this international conference of hundreds of transit activists from around the world. As a member of the board of directors for the New Orleans Community Bike Project, I was honored to participate in the organizing effort for such a huge event.
